# libft42
## My very first own library<br>
It was my very first project at 42 SÃ£o Paulo and its aim was to create my first **library**<br>
<br>
To compile this library type:
```
make
```
Then, you can use it in your projects by including:
```
#include "libft.h"
```
And compiling with these flags:
```
-lft -L ./libft/libft.a -I ./libft/libft.h
```
To delete the objects and the executable file, type:
```
make fclean
```
To understand this project better, read the [subject](https://github.com/anolivei/libft42/blob/master/en.subject.pdf)<br>
